# VS Code JavaScript Booster [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/xsburg/vscode-javascript-booster.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/xsburg/vscode-javascript-booster)

Make your life easier, use code actions to do repetitive tasks for you! They can do a lot, just follow the light bulb [ðŸ’¡]!

This VS Code extension provides various code actions (quick fixes) when editing code in JavaScript (or TypeScript/Flow). Just note the light bulb at the left and press it to learn how you can transform the code under the cursor.

It might worth assigning a shortcut to open the bulb, search for `editor.action.quickFix` command.

## Inspiration

Largely inspired by [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) and its variety of code refactorings. The extension uses [Babylon](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babylon) to parse the code and then manipulates the abstract syntax tree using [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).

<!-- ## Extension Settings
